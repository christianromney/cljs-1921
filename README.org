* Repro Case for CLJS-1921

This repository contains ClojureSript source files that
attempt to reproduce a problem reported in [[https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-1921][JIRA]] about
constant redefinition errors.

**  Caveats
The ticket states that this problem is non-deterministic, failing only "when the
stars align". This repo is only intended to make it easy for others to try
reproducing the reported issue.

** Building

 - Run ~make clean serial~ to try building the code without parallelism.
 - Run ~make clean parallel~ to try building the code with the ~:parallel-build~
   compiler option.
